Hey, I'm Denny Scott and I am a Web Developer, where I work primarily in Javascript and React. I grew up in the frozen city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and work abroad now. My favourite area's include web performance, module bundlers, and building development tools.

I've been developing websites for 15 years , starting on hacking together small websites and blogger themes when I was a teenager. Some of my earliest memories in web development includes making websites for different guild/groups from my favourite games at the time. I hid my interest from most of my friends, thinking there was no such thing as a career in web development. I assumed there was no way people would pay for this, everyone just did it for fun. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I've developed web apps ranging from typical lean startup prototypes, to enterprise apps responsible for millions of dollars. The most important piece to me is working with fun people, where we all are looking to learn and push each other.

Lots of solid tv refs don't hurt either.
